***********************************

Particle Distort Texture bundles 2 sets of assets, the distort 
texture shaders for particle system and particle effect library with 
customized textures. The particles make use of the water distortion 
calculations to create special visual effects which is all done 
by blending the textures.

The distortion works in Unity Personal edition because it only 
distorts the base texture mounted on the material rather than 
the graphic content behind the texture. 
In any case, our distort shader allows you to achieve the animated 
distortion effect without using animated texture because the 
distortion is being calculated in real time. This has the 
advantage of adjustability in terms of distortion shape, size and speed.
